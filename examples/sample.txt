This is a sample text file for testing the FTT (File Type Tester) tool.

It contains multiple lines of plain ASCII text, with various characters and formatting.

Here are some features that should be detected:
- Regular sentences with punctuation.
- Numbers like 123, 456.789, and dates like 2024-01-01.
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()_+{}|:"<>?[]
- Unicode characters: café, naïve, résumé

The file should be classified as "text" by the FTT tool because it contains
only printable characters and common control characters (like newlines and tabs).

This is exactly the type of file that users expect to have the word "text"
printed, as mentioned in the requirements.

	This line starts with a tab character.
  This line has leading spaces.

End of sample text file.
